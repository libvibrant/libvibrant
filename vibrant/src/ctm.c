   *
   * RandR currently uses long types for 32-bit integer format. However,
   * 64-bit systems will use 64-bits for long, causing data corruption
   * once RandR parses the data. Therefore, pad the blob_data to be long-
   * sized. This will work regardless of how long is defined (long is
   * at least 32-bits).
   *
   * Note that we have a 32-bit format restriction; we have to interpret
   * each S31.32 fixed point number within the CTM in two parts: The
   * whole part (S31), and the fractional part (.32). They're then stored
   * (as separate parts) into a long-typed array. Of course, this problem
   * wouldn't exist if xserver accepted 64-bit formats directly, instead of
   * two at least 32-bits sized parts.
   *
   * A gotcha here is the endianness of the S31.32 values. The whole part
   * will either come before or after the fractional part. We could avoid
   * dealing with this by doing a straight memory copy, but we have to
   * ensure that each 32-bit element is padded to long-size in the
   * process.
   *
   * We just assume little-endian, which is why we don't even bother.
